> This CLI syncs the npm package version to the capacitor android and ios projects.

Capacitor creates a folder for each platform in the root of your project, like `android`, `ios`, and `electron`.
Since electron is in beta right now, it's not supported by this tool.

Capacitor does not deal with syncing the version number from your package.json to the mobile projects,
mainly because this sync is not 1 to 1 possible without assumtions.
This cli uses an automatic alogrithm to calculate the android versionCode based on the version string from package.json.
The android versionCode is an ever increasing integer-32 defining the unique version for each app.

## Install

```
npm i cap-sync-version
```

## Android Notes

In Android the plugin will automatically make the following modifications:

1. Add the following after `apply plugin: 'com.android.application'` at the top of `./android/app/build.gradle`:

    ```
    def appProperties = new Properties();
    file("app.properties").withInputStream { appProperties.load(it) }
    ```

2. Use these new properties to set `versionCode` and `versionName` in `./android/app/build.gradle`

    ```
    defaultConfig {
        versionCode appProperties.getProperty('versionCode').toInteger()
        versionName appProperties.getProperty('versionName')
    }
    ```

3. Create a file called `app.properties` under `./android/app/` with the following two properties to the file:

    ```
    versionName: 0.0.1
    versionCode: 1
    ```

    Note: These values will be overwritten with the next call to this `cap-sync-version` cli.

## iOS Notes

Nothing to say

## CLI Usage

  -p, --android-allow-prerelease  Note: This flag is disabled since 2.0.0 and will be ignored, because it produced unrelieable version codes in android.  (default: false)
  -i, --ios                       Sync package version to ios.  It will not update Android, unless --android is specified. (default: false)

# FAQ

## Why is there no prerelease support on android anymore since version 2.0?

Note: Periods in example android version codes are for better readability

1. A version of 2.3.5-0 would have a version code of `2.030.500`
   and the version 2.3.5 would also have the version code `2.030.500`, since the prerelease digits are zero per default.
2. A version of 2.3.5-1 would have a higher version code as 2.3.5, even though 2.3.5 is the final version of 2.3.5-1.
   Version 2.3.5-1 would have the code `2.030.501`, but version 2.3.5 would have the code `2.030.500`, which would result in rejection of the built apk or aab by the google play console.
3. iOS is not able to encode prerelease versions like this altogether.

One could fix above errors, but not without making the version generation algorithm more complicated and less intuitive.
And when looking at the fact, that iOS doesn't even support prerelease versions, I'll simply increase the headroom of patch versions (where the developer can decide to mark them as beta or something).
